      <p>My name is Sebastián Maldoando, and I was born and raised on the island of Puerto Rico. Currently I'm a 
          sophmore Computer Science and Engineering student at the Universiy of Puerto Rico of Mayagüez. In this page you will
          be able to find a virutal portfolio containing different details about me. This webpage was developed as part of participating in 
          Google's Software Product Sprint Spring 2021.

      <p> I was born in May of '01 in the town of Arecibo, but lived most of my life in Hatillo. For two years I lived in Corozal, and for almost 4 years now I have lived
          in the northern town of Manatí. I enjoy eating; I love trying new foods and getting to know cultures through their gastronmic delights. That being said, I truly
          believe that my island has one of the best varieties of meals and plates! One of my passions is to take pictures of the sky. I feel the sky is so underrated, so I
          try to capture it's magic as best as I can. Personally, it's the night sky that has the most beauty to it; a gateway to the universe. So, I could say I do "photogrpahy"
          for fun with my handy smartphone camera (click the image for more).

      <p>In Augsut of 2019, I began my bachelor of science in the Universiy of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. I enrolled in the Faculty of Engineering, in the Department of 
          Computer Science and Engineering. I ventured into the world of CS without any previous experience or even basiv knowledge about its topics. Yet, I have found a
          great passion for it. I enjoy how there are many ways do solve a single problem, and all the logic and math behind it! I see Computer Science as a way of living,
          it opens up new ways of thinking. My campus, UPRM, has provided me with great tools, like diverse classes and extense curriculums, that have taught me and develop
          even further my programming and math skills.
